FINAL SUMMARY
============================================================

Overall Performance Summary:
  Binary approach wins:     1/3 metrics
  Multi-class approach wins: 2/3 metrics

üèÜ WINNER: Multi-class (A/B/C/D) Classification Approach

Key Insights:
- Total datasets compared: 32
- Binary approach: Uses hyperparameter tuning for n_bins
- Multi-class approach: Uses fixed evaluation time points (n_eval_times)
- Statistical significance should be interpreted considering p-values
- Effect sizes indicate practical significance of differences
- Individual dataset performance may vary significantly
